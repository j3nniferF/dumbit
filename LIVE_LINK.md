# 🎯 Quick Answer: Where to View Your App

## Your Live App Link:

# 🔗 **https://j3nniferF.github.io/dumbit/**

---

## What You Can Do:

1. **Click the link above** to open your task manager app
2. **Share this link** with anyone - they can use your app too!
3. **Bookmark it** in your browser for easy access

---

## Your App Features:

When you open the link, you'll have access to all features:

✅ Four task tabs (Due Today, Next Up, When I Can, Don't Forget)

## Important Notes:

- ⚠️ **Deployment Fix Applied**: I fixed the GitHub Pages configuration that was preventing proper deployment
- ⏱️ **Wait Time**: After merging to `main`, wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
- 💾 **Data Storage**: Your tasks are saved in your browser's localStorage (local to each device)
- 🔄 **Auto-Updates**: Every time you push to `main`, the app auto-deploys

---

## Can't See the App Yet?

If the link doesn't work yet, it's because:
1. These changes are still in the PR branch (`copilot/add-branch-ruleset`)
2. Once you **merge this PR to main**, it will auto-deploy
3. Takes 1-2 minutes after merge

---

## Alternative: Test Locally Now

Want to test before it deploys? Run this:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/dumbit/dumbit
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open: http://localhost:8080
