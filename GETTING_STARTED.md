- Refresh with: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

## 🆘 Quick Commands

### Check what changed:
```bash
git status
```

### See what branch you're on:
```bash
git branch
```

### Get latest changes from GitHub:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### Save and push changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your message here"
git push origin main
```

## 💡 Moving Forward

### What You Should Do:

✅ **Always work on `main` branch** - It's simpler!  
✅ **Test locally first** - Run `python3 -m http.server 8000`  
✅ **Save often** - Commit and push regularly  
✅ **Check your live site** after pushing  

### What You Don't Need to Worry About:

❌ **Multiple branches** - You just need `main`  
❌ **Complex workflows** - Just edit, commit, push!  
❌ **Workspace files** - All cleaned up!  

## 🎸 Tips for Success

1. **Make small changes** - Easier to track and fix
2. **Test locally first** - Make sure it works before pushing
3. **Write clear commit messages** - "fixed timer bug" not "updates"
4. **Don't stress** - You have a backup, and Git tracks everything!

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Where do I code?**  
A: In VS Code on your computer, or directly on GitHub.com

**Q: How do I see my changes live?**  
A: Push to main branch, wait 1-2 minutes, refresh your site

**Q: What if I mess up?**  
A: You have a backup! Plus Git saves every version

**Q: Should I create new branches?**  
A: No need! For a solo project, just use `main`
