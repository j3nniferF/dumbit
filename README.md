MVP
This project is a small, focused task manager inspired by a physical notepad, designed to break large chores into satisfyingly small actions. The app lets users add tasks into four tabs (Due Today, Next Up, When I Can, Don’t Forget), mark tasks complete, and keeps all tasks persisted so progress is retained across sessions.

Core features

- Add and remove tasks and mark tasks done/undone.
- Four tabbed task lists (Due Today / Next Up / When I Can / Don’t Forget).
- Persist tasks in localStorage so items remain after closing the browser.
- Simple timer hook (duration select) and a selectable "current task" area (placeholders to expand).
