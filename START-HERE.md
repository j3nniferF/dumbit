# ✨ START HERE - Quick Guide

Hey! Your repo has been cleaned up and simplified. Here's what you need to know:

## 📖 Read These Files (In Order):

1. **CLEANUP-SUMMARY.md** ← Read this first! Explains what I did
2. **HOW-TO-USE.md** ← Your everyday guide for making changes
3. **README.md** ← Quick project overview

## 🎯 What You Need to Do Right Now:

### Step 1: Merge This Branch to Main
This branch (`copilot/test-code-on-gh-pages`) has all the cleanup changes.

**On GitHub.com:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/j3nniferF/dumbit
2. Look for the yellow banner at the top
3. Click **"Compare & pull request"**
4. Click **"Create pull request"**
5. Click **"Merge pull request"**
6. Click **"Confirm merge"**
7. Click **"Delete branch"** when it asks

**Done!** Your main branch now has the cleaned-up code! ✅

### Step 2: Clean Up Old Branches (Optional)
You have 16 old branches that you don't need anymore.

**To delete them:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/j3nniferF/dumbit/branches
2. Find old branches like:
   - `copilot/cleanup-redundant-files`
   - `copilot/update-page-to-current-state`
   - All the other `copilot/*` branches
   - `backup-gh-pages`
   - `gh-pages` (if you're using `main` now)
3. Click the trash icon 🗑️ next to each one
4. Keep only `main`

**Note:** This is optional! Old branches don't hurt anything - they're just clutter.

### Step 3: Start Working!
From now on:
- Just work on the `main` branch
- Make changes
- Push to GitHub
- Your site updates automatically!

## 🚀 Quick Start Workflow:

```bash
# Option A: Edit on GitHub.com (easiest!)
# Just edit files directly on GitHub and commit

# Option B: Edit locally
# 1. Make changes to files
# 2. Test: python3 -m http.server 8000
# 3. Push to GitHub when happy
```

## ❓ Common Questions:

**Q: Where do I edit my code?**
A: Edit directly on main branch (either on GitHub.com or locally)

**Q: How do I see my changes live?**
A: Push to main, wait 30 seconds, check https://j3nniferF.github.io/dumbit/

**Q: What if I break something?**
A: You have a zip backup, and GitHub keeps all your commit history

**Q: Do I need to understand Git to use this?**
A: Nope! Just edit and push. That's it!

**Q: Should I create branches?**
A: Not necessary for a solo project. Work on main!
